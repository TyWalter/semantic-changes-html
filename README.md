# Semantic Changes (Horiseon Edits)

## Description
This is a web page that was given as an assignment for class and I had to go through and add semantic changes to it while having the page appear the same way as it did before any changes were implemented.

## Visuals
* ![Here is a screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot.png) Here is a screenshot of the Horiseon Page.
* [Link to deployed application](https://tywalter.github.io/semantic-changes-html/)

## Usage
This application is a test of my knowledge and abilities to take starter-code that was given to me and correct some semantic changes and combine some css selectors to clean things up.
